To use regex in quick search, string must start and end with a slash character (/).
Regex is supported for all properties in the "Search in" filter.

Examples:

|  Expression      |   Description       |
|---------|--------|
| /java\|node/    |     will match "java" or "node" string |
| /^Find/        |     will match properties starting with "Find" |
| /er$/            |   will match properties ending with "er" |
| /202[0-5]/     |     will match years 2020 - 2025 |
